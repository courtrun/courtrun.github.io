title: "Factors of transurethral incision effectiveness for ureteroceles in pediatric patients: A 28-year, single-institution retrospective review"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-UreteroceleTUI
excerpt: 'As a congenital anomaly, ureteroceles occur in 1 in 4000 children, and are usually diagnosed prenatally. Initial management typically includes early transurethral incision (TUI) of ureterocele, or observation with the option for lower urinary tract reconstruction once the patient is older. There is currently no consensus on best practices for the decision between initial TUI and conservative management. An important advantage of TUI is that it is less invasive and can be performed on patients soon after birth. However, many physicians delay treatment until the patients are older and able to undergo alternative options such as lower urinary tract reconstruction. Thus, identification of factors that accurately predict TUI success in pediatric ureterocele patients will enable more informed management decisions, earlier treatment, better patient outcomes, and decreased financial burden related to additional surgeries. Here, we leverage our institution's database records from 1993 to 2021 to evaluate the effectiveness of initial TUI ureterocele in 75 pediatric patients and identify pre- and post-operative factors that correlated with TUI effectiveness. We find initial TUI was an effective procedure for the majority of our pediatric ureterocele patients, a higher success rate compared to other cohorts. Patients with a simplex system were more likely to have an effective first TUI than patients with duplex systems, as were patients without preoperative reflux. Although not statistically significant, our data suggest prior UTI, prenatal diagnosis, higher preoperative hydronephrosis grade, and the use of electrocautery may be associated with having additional surgeries. <br />
